In simple terms, It allows to store and manipulate the given code. On the other hand, Constants are like variables but its value do not change once it assigned. Lastly, Literals. literals are the the values that unexchangeable. this values represent the data such as name, numbers or special values like pi.\n",

We practiced writing a simple program to compute a student's final grade depending on their Prelim, Midterm, and Final grades. The program will use formulas for combining exam scores, quizzes, assignments, and hands-on activities. We made the code easier to understand by including comments. In this activity, we saw how Python could be used for real-life problems, such as grade calculations.\n"
